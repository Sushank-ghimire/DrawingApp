# DrawingApp

**DrawingApp** is a web-based drawing application built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**. It enables users to create drawings using different color options and download their artwork as an image file. The application is developed with a focus on **type safety** using TypeScript, ensuring robust and maintainable code.

## Features

- **Canvas Drawing**: Users can freely draw on the canvas using mouse or touch input.
- **Multiple Color Options**: A variety of colors are available for drawing, allowing users to express their creativity.
- **Download Artwork**: After completing the drawing, users can download their creation as an image file.
- **Type Safety**: The application is built with TypeScript to ensure type safety and reduce potential bugs during development.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool for modern web applications.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript for adding static types.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Used for drawing operations.
